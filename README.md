# "The UNIX Timesharing System" Paper
This repository tracks the changes to the "Unix Timesharing System" paper
written by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. This was the paper, published
in the Communications of the ACM in 1974, which introduced UNIX to the
general public.

There are five known versions of this paper:

1. A draft of this paper, written in mid-1971 by Dennis Ritchie, available at
   [https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/McIlroy_v0/UnixEditionZero-Threshold_OCR.pdf].
2. The presentation of the paper made by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson in
   1973 at the fourth Symposium on Operating System Principles. It appears
   that only the abstract of the presentation was published.
3. The version of the paper as it appeared in 1974 in the Communications of
   the ACM.
4. The version of the paper made available in the 6th Edition of UNIX,
   available at
   [https://minnie.tuhs.org//cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/doc/unix].
5. The version of the paper published in 1978 in the Bell System Technical
   Journal.

There may also be a version of the paper from around 1972 which is still
in the Nokia Bell Labs archives. This has yet to be confirmed.
