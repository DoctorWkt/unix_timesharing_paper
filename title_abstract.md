## ABSTRACT

UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system
for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It
offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems,
including:

1. a hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes;
2. compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O;
3. the ability to initiate asynchronous processes;
4. system command language selectable on a per-user basis; and
5. over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages.

This paper discusses the usage and implementation of the file
system and of the user command interface.

Key Words and Phrases: time-sharing, operating system, file system,
command language, PDP-11
