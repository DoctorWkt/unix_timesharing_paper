## ABSTRACT

UNIX is a general-purpose, multi-user, interactive operating system
for the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11/40 and 11/45 computers. It
offers a number of features seldom found even in larger operating systems,
including

1. A hierarchical file system incorporating demountable volumes,
2. Compatible file, device, and inter-process I/O,
3. The ability to initiate asynchronous processes,
4. System command language selectable on a per-user basis,
5. Over 100 subsystems including a dozen languages.

This paper discusses the usage and implementation of the file
system and of the user command interface.
